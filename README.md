# TensorFlowDeepDive
I will put here analysis on tensorflow source code, and some example code.

If possible, document will be provided in two-languages: English and Chinese, but some may be only in one Chinese because of limited time.

### Planned topics
* [TensorFlow Overview] - some background about tensorflow, including history and its features
* [Build TensorFlow] - a guide to build tensorflow on Ubuntu 14.04
* [A Simple TensorFlow Application] - let's have a look at a simple application, introducce TensorFlow's main concepts
* [Session] - what's behind tensorflow's "Session"
* [Op] - "Op" is the most important concept in tensorflow, let's have a look how it's implemented
* [Runtime View] - some runtime information will be put here
* [Models] - tensorflow provides some built-in algorithms/models, besides original documents, additional information will be put here
* [Optimizations] - some benchmarking data, and optimizations
* [Resources] - there are many algorithms/models/papers based on tensorflow, we will collect them here.
